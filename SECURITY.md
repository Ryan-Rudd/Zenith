## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in Zenith, we ask that you please respect the following vulnerability disclosure process:

1. Do not create a public GitHub issue.
2. Email the details of the vulnerability to [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].
3. Allow us time to investigate the issue and respond to you. Our goal is to respond to all security vulnerabilities within 48 hours.
4. Do not disclose the vulnerability to others until we've had a chance to address it.

We take all security reports seriously. After receiving a report, we will investigate the issue and, if necessary, release a patch to fix the vulnerability. We will also publicly acknowledge the vulnerability and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for your help in keeping Zenith safe!
